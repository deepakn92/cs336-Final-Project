Car Accident Database
â€¢	 RDS(MySQL) based backend website that used Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host and utilize MySQL engine to build an extensive 1000+ car accident database, with car accident info (time, date, location and car specs) Implemented location based accident searching, a probability of accident occurring in area which in turn can predict your insurance rate based on prior accident history/accident frequency near address; all this used and implemented a multifunctional database using SQL queries and multiple tables

Although the program contains a very amateur/basic algorithm, We plan to implement a much more industry standard, and effective as well as time and space efficient algorithm to calculate insurance costs based on the accident frequency parameters..
